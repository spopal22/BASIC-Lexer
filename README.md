# BASIC Lexer

## Overview

The BASIC Lexer project is a fundamental tool designed to tokenize BASIC programming language code. It efficiently analyzes BASIC code and breaks it down into individual tokens, which are essential components for further processing by compilers, interpreters, or other software tools. Using Java programming, the project employs lexing techniques to identify and categorize different elements within the code accurately for future use.

## Features

- **Tokenization:** Parses BASIC code into distinct tokens, including keywords, identifiers, numbers, strings, and symbols, facilitating subsequent stages of compilation or interpretation.
- **Handling Keywords:** Recognizes and categorizes keywords specific to the BASIC programming language, such as print, read, input, data, for, if, then, function, and more.
- **Character Processing:** Efficiently processes individual characters, identifying their roles in forming tokens, whether as part of identifiers, numbers, or symbols.
- **String Literal Handling:** Handles string literals, including escape characters, ensuring accurate tokenization of strings within the BASIC code.
- **Position Tracking:** Tracks the position of tokens within the code, providing useful information for debugging or error reporting purposes.
- **Abstract Syntax Tree:** Parser is implemented to convert the stream of tokens into AST nodes. This allows for ease of parsing and a more structured representation.

## Key Data Structures

- **HashMap:** Utilized for efficient storage and retrieval of keywords mapped to their corresponding token types, optimizing the process of identifying keywords within the BASIC code.
- **LinkedList:** Employed to construct a collection of tokens, enabling dynamic management and traversal of token sequences during the lexing process.
- **Abstract Syntax Tree:** Used to convert our stream of tokens into AST nodes for more structure, easier parsing, more optimization, and ease of debugging.

## Getting Started

To utilize the BASIC Lexer project, follow these steps:

- Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-lexer.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd basic-lexer`
- Compile the source code: `javac Basic.java Lexer.java Token.java CodeHandler.java Parser.java`
- Run the lexer: `java Basic your-basic-code-file.txt`
- Review the output tokens generated by the lexer for further processing or analysis.

## Usage

- Launch the application by executing the compiled Java program.
- Provide the BASIC code file you want to tokenize as a command-line argument.
- The lexer will process the code and output a list of tokens, including their types, line numbers, positions, and values (if applicable).
- Utilize the tokenized output for subsequent stages of compilation, interpretation, or analysis of the BASIC code.
